  "description": "Quest Particles allows you to boost/reduce/remove note slash particles, saber clash particles, remove environmental dust, and make particle rainbow.\r\n\r\nThis mod does nothing out of the box. You will need to use the in-game mod config UI (Settings -> Mod Settings -> ParticleTuner) to change the particle behaviors.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n* Particles having white tints in rainbow mode (colorOverLifetime?)\r\n* Sometimes the preset buttons may fail to work (please lmk if you can reproduce this issue consistently)",
